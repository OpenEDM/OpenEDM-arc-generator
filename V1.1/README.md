# OpenEDM Arc Generator V1

## Status

This design has been built and tested, confirming the viability of the topology. All design files are available except for the PCB layout, which I chose not to publish in order to prevent exact replication of this version, as it still contains several issues (see [OpenEDM Arc Generator V1.1: Known Issues](https://github.com/OpenEDM/OpenEDM-arc-generator/blob/main/V1.1/OpenEDM-arc-generator-V1.1-known-issues.md)). These problems are expected to be resolved in V2, whose complete set of files will hopefully be released without exceptions.

1. [Simulation.](https://github.com/OpenEDM/OpenEDM-arc-generator/tree/main/V1.1/Simulation) You need to have [QSPICE](https://www.qorvo.com/design-hub/design-tools/interactive/qspice) installed to open the project. **It has not yet been confirmed that the simulation accurately matches reality**, so do not blindly trust the results.
