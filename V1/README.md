# OpenEDM Arc Generator V1

## Status

This design has been built and tested, confirming that the topology is viable. The latest version is **V1.1**. All design files are available except for the PCB layout. I am not publishing the PCB design because I donâ€™t want this device to be replicated exactly as it is, since it has some issues (see [OpenEDM Arc Generator V1.1: Known Issues](https://github.com/OpenEDM/OpenEDM-arc-generator/blob/main/V1/OpenEDM-arc-generator-V1.1-known-issues.md)). Hopefully, all of these issues will be fixed in **V2**, and its files will be released without exceptions.
